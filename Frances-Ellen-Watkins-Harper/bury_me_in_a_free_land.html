Make me a grave where'er you will, In a lowly plain, or a lofty hill; Make it among earth's humblest graves, But not in a land where men are slaves. I could not rest if around my <del style='background-color:#ff9933'>grave</del><ins style='background-color:#00ff66'>tomb</ins> I heard the steps of a <del style='background-color:#ff9933'>trembling </del>slave<ins style='background-color:#00ff66'>'s lone gloom</ins>; <del style='background-color:#ff9933'>His</del><ins style='background-color:#00ff66'>Nor</ins> <del style='background-color:#ff9933'>shadow above my silent tomb W</del><ins style='background-color:#00ff66'>c</ins>ould <del style='background-color:#ff9933'>mak</del><ins style='background-color:#00ff66'>I sl</ins>e<ins style='background-color:#00ff66'>ep</ins> i<ins style='background-color:#00ff66'>f I saw </ins>t<ins style='background-color:#00ff66'>he lash Drinking her blood</ins> a<ins style='background-color:#00ff66'>t</ins> <del style='background-color:#ff9933'>pl</del><ins style='background-color:#00ff66'>e</ins>ac<del style='background-color:#ff9933'>e of</del><ins style='background-color:#00ff66'>h</ins> fearful g<ins style='background-color:#00ff66'>ash.

I could not rest if I heard the tread Of a coffle gang to the shambles led, And the mother's shriek of wild despair Rise like a curse on the trembling air. I could not sleep if I saw the lash Drinking her blood at each fearful gash, And I saw her babes torn from her breast, Like trembling doves from their parent nest. I'd shudder and start if I heard the bay Of bloodhounds seizing their human prey, And I heard the captive plead in vain As they bound afresh his galling chain. If I saw young girls from their mother's arms Bartered and sold for their youthful charms, My eye would flash with a mournful flame, My death-paled cheek grow red with shame. I would sleep, dear friends, where bloated might Can rob no man of his dearest right; My rest shall be calm in any grave Where none can call his brother a slave. I ask no monument, proud and high, To arrest the gaze of the passers-by; All that my yearning spirit craves, Is bury me not in a land of slaves.
