Heard you that shriek? It rose So wildly on the air, It seem<del style='background-color:#ff9933'>’</del><ins style='background-color:#00ff66'>e</ins>d as if a burden<del style='background-color:#ff9933'>’</del><ins style='background-color:#00ff66'>'</ins>d heart Was breaking in despair. Saw you those hands so sadly clasped— The bowed and feeble head— The shuddering of that fragile form— That look of grief and dread? Saw you the sad, imploring eye? Its every glance was pain, As if a storm of agony Were sweeping through the brain. She is a mother pale with fear, Her boy clings to her side, And in her k<del style='background-color:#ff9933'>y</del><ins style='background-color:#00ff66'>i</ins>rtle vainly tries His trembling form to hide.

He is not hers, for cruel hands May rudely tear apart The only wreath of household love That binds her breaking heart. His love has been a joyous light That o<del style='background-color:#ff9933'>’</del><ins style='background-color:#00ff66'>'</ins>er her pathway smiled, A fountain gushing ever new, Amid life<del style='background-color:#ff9933'>’</del><ins style='background-color:#00ff66'>'</ins>s desert wild. His lightest word has been a tone Of music round her heart, Their lives a streamlet blent in one— Oh, Father! must they part? They tear him from her circling arms, Her last and fond embrace. Oh<del style='background-color:#ff9933'>!</del><ins style='background-color:#00ff66'>,</ins> never more may her sad eyes Gaze on his mournful face. No marvel, then, these bitter shrieks Disturb the listening air: She is a mother, and her heart Is breaking in despair.
